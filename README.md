# ðŸŒ± Python Frameworks Assignment

This project is part of a Python assignment exploring frameworks for **data analysis and visualization**.  
It demonstrates working with **Jupyter Notebooks** for analysis and a **Streamlit app** for interactive visualization.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:

- Practice using **Pandas** for data loading and exploration.
- Build **visualizations** with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- Create a simple **Streamlit app** with interactive widgets.
- Learn how to manage large datasets in GitHub-friendly ways.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset (`metadata.csv`) is too large (>100 MB) to store directly on GitHub.

ðŸ‘‰ Download it here: [Download metadata.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yvy8MeXmUHEply-68B_fzWLx8jFjKuTN/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading, place it in the projectâ€™s root folder:

frameworks_assignment/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â””â”€â”€ ...

yaml
Copy code

The app includes:

A title and description.

Interactive widgets (slider, dropdown).

Visualizations.

A data sample preview.

âœ… Requirements
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt, including:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

streamlit

ðŸ“Œ Notes
The dataset is cached in the app for faster loading.

Large files are excluded from GitHub using .gitignore.
